We took over the complete marketing strategy and execution, from analysis and message positioning to creative production and campaign optimization. In less than two months, the quota was achieved and exceeded by 21 registrations.",

      "overview": "For the winter season, Bestdrive Maja Gume's goal was to launch winter tire sales through the webshop via Meta campaigns. Through analysis, we determined that the webshop was not properly connected to the Meta Business system, which prevented reliable measurement and optimization towards sales. Therefore, we first integrated the webshop with the Meta Business account, set up Pixel and key Purchase and Initiate Checkout events to enable algorithm learning and deliver real results.",
      "challenge": "Due to the short deadline for implementation, we connected the product catalog in parallel and set up sets in Meta Ads, and created 10 static visuals with different angles tailored to the target group. The communication focus was on simple webshop purchasing, fast delivery, and a clear ordering process. Over a 30-day period, the campaign achieved 222 web purchases with a total spend of $241.85, with a cost per purchase ranging from $0.37 to $8.60 per set."

      "overview": "It Works is a health and wellness e-commerce brand that sells through a webshop in the USA, targeting women 25-45.

      "challenge": "We took over the complete execution: creative approach, scripts, video design and editing, and running Meta Ads campaigns towards sales. Instead of generic ads, we built creative that builds trust and clearly communicates the value proposition, then tested performance through separate sets by creative type (statics and videos) to get clean learning and faster optimizations. In the period Oct 1, 2025 - Dec 9, 2025, the campaign achieved 2,049 website purchases, with a cost per purchase ranging from $3.83 to $5.17 per set, with a total of 753,213 impressions on displayed ad sets."

The client did not have a Meta Ads account, and the goal was clear: increase the number of scheduled store visits with an acquisition of $20 or less per customer, within a very narrow radius of 5 miles around the location.",
      "challenge": "We took over the complete setup and campaign execution, from opening and connecting the Meta Ads system, to setting up Pixel and tracking, then creating offers and creative for the local audience. The message focus was on the main customer pain point: the need for an additional key at an affordable price for peace of mind, worn-out keys, or increasing vehicle value. We set up the campaign as a local funnel that quickly converts attention into inquiry and concrete store visits. In the first 30 days, the campaign achieved 141 Meta leads with an average cost of $3.73 per lead, with a total spend of $525.76."

      "challenge": "We built the creative through 3 videos: 2 talking head videos (club director and a famous young athlete training at the club) and one faceless video with program specifications and benefits, plus 5 static visuals with different approaches for testing and better Meta Andromeda algorithm learning. Within 12 days, the campaign generated 105 qualified leads, after which the client requested pausing the campaign due to lack of capacity to process applications and enrollment."

Since this is a new app, we used a landing page as an intermediate step before download, so parents could clearly familiarize themselves with the project and benefits before making a decision.",
      "challenge": "We created the strategy, plan, and complete Meta Ads campaign execution, and built creative that clearly communicates the app's purpose and value for parents. We delivered 7 static visuals and 4 video ads with different angles and variations to get stable learning and optimization. In the first 30 days, the campaign achieved 190 app downloads.",
